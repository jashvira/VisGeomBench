# Abstract

Visual Geometry Bench (VGBench) evaluates how large language models reason about geometric and topological structure from text alone. The suite probes core abilities: recovering global shape and extremal structure; inferring combinatorial triangulations under metric invariances; establishing necessary edge connections and junctions from boundary labels; mapping between hierarchical subdivisions and exact adjacency; satisfying discrete tiling constraints; and constructive partition design with specified region counts. We target invariance to relabelling and order, robustness to clutter and near‑degeneracy, and compositional reasoning across local‑to‑global cues, providing a focused measure of text‑only visual geometry competence.


Interesting questions to show:
- change of corner configurations in N domains meeting in quad.
